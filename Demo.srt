1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Which is better, AML or WebDev for secure future and more earning.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first thing is that no one knows about future.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
AML is still a little bit early.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We are going through a lot of things.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We have already booked a ticket.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We are going through a lot of blockchains.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So these are trends that we are going through.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So you have to learn from one day.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The main thing is, the concept is the basic clear.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The base is your strongness.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The C++ Python is the strongest.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When you are trying to catch a trend,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But you are starting to learn AML now.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Because now, the 24th is still the same.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The 23th is not the 23th.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The 23th is still a little bit early.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Because, the things are coming out.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The models are getting designed.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Everything is growing.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So this will be the trend.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, take care of this.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
After that, keep the base strong.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you want to jump into something in the future,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then you can do it.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now, you can do AML inside Python.
